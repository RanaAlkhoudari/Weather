# Weather

The project enables the user to get information about the weather in any city.

The project fetchs the data from openweathermap api.

# must have

The app needs to be a single page application. That means only one index.html file and JavaScript needs to update the html using DOM manipulation.

The app needs to interact with an API to grab data.

The app needs to have loading/error handling for the interaction with the API.

The app needs some user interaction such that you need to grab different data from the API. So you cannot just grab everything from the API and store it locally.


# nice to have

The app needs to interact with another endpoint from the same API to grab data.

The app needs to interact with other API to grab data.
